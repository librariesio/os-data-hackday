# Open Source Data Hackday - 10am - 7pm Saturday 28th May  [![Slack Status](https://osdatahack-slackin.herokuapp.com/badge.svg)](https://osdatahack-slackin.herokuapp.com/)

With data on 8m repositories, 7m issues/pull requests and 33m dependencies, Libraries.io has a wealth of data that can be used to help open source projects by highlighting key issues or important projects that need more help.

It currently has a basic API but much more advanced ones could be built to make data extraction easier to build tools on top of it.

Register your interest on Attending.io: https://attending.io/events/open-source-data-hackday

Join us on slack: https://osdatahack-slackin.herokuapp.com/

Feel free to open an issue with questions or ideas: https://github.com/librariesio/os-data-hackday/issues
